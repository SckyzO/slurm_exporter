## Features

- Export CPU, GPU, node, job, and partition metrics from Slurm
- Optional GPU accounting (`--gpus-acct`)
- TLS and Basic Auth support via [Exporter Toolkit](https://github.com/prometheus/exporter-toolkit)
- Ready-to-use Grafana dashboard

---

## Installation

1. Build as described in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) and copy `bin/slurm_exporter` to a node with Slurm CLI access.
2. (Optional) Use the Systemd unit: [lib/systemd/prometheus-slurm-exporter.service](lib/systemd/prometheus-slurm-exporter.service)  
   *Note: I have not personally tested this unit; it is a leftover from the original fork.*
3. (Optional) Snap package: see [packages/snap/README.md](packages/snap/README.md)  
   *Note: I have not personally tested the Snap packaging; it is a leftover from the original fork.*

---

## Usage

**Basic:**
```bash
./slurm_exporter --web.listen-address=:8080
```

**With GPU accounting:**
```bash
./slurm_exporter --web.listen-address=:8080 --gpus-acct
```

**With TLS/Basic Auth:**
```bash
./slurm_exporter --web.listen-address=:8080 --web.config.file=/path/to/web-config.yml
```

> **Note:** GPU accounting is **disabled by default**. Use `--gpus-acct` to enable.

**Sample `web-config.yml`:**
```yaml
tls_server_config:
  cert_file: /path/to/cert.crt
  key_file: /path/to/cert.key
basic_auth_users:
  admin: $2y$12$EXAMPLE_ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD_HASH
```
See [Exporter Toolkit documentation](https://github.com/prometheus/exporter-toolkit/blob/master/docs/web-configuration.md) for details.

## Prometheus Configuration

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'slurm_exporter'
    scrape_interval: 30s
    scrape_timeout: 30s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['slurm_host.fqdn:8080']
```

- **scrape_interval**: 30s to avoid overloading Slurm master.
- **scrape_timeout**: Set to avoid `context_deadline_exceeded` errors.

Check config:
```bash
promtool check-config prometheus.yml
```
